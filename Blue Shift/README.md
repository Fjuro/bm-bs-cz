## [EN] How to compile the files
### Subtitles
1. Download the [closecaption_czech.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fjuro/bm-bs-cz/main/Blue%20Shift/closecaption_czech.txt) file (press Ctrl + S)
2. Go to your Steam library, right click Black Mesa and click on **Browse local files**
3. Go to the `bshift` folder and copy the `gameinfo.txt` file
4. Go back to your Black Mesa directory and then go to the `bin` folder
5. Paste the `gameinfo.txt` file there
6. Drag & drop the file you have downloaded in the first step on the `captioncompiler.exe` file (it's also in the `bin` folder)
7. Your subtitles file should be almost immediately compiled as `closecaption_czech.dat`
### VPK
1. If you have not already done so, follow the steps above
2. Download [GCFScape](https://nemstools.github.io/pages/GCFScape-Download.html)
3. Open the downloaded program 
4. Click on the ![Open](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40403606/177190981-2b36c7f1-f4a4-46ce-8471-59549d0e9851.png) **Open** button
5. Locate your Black Mesa directory and open the `bshift` folder
6. Doubleclick the `bshift_misc_dir.vpk` file
7. In GCFSCape, right click the `root` directory and click ![extract](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40403606/177191519-62a02a47-edd8-4d3d-9376-4e3c88d88fd2.png) **Extract**
8. Extract the folder somewhere safe (e.g. your desktop)
9. Download the remaining files from [this directory](https://github.com/Fjuro/bm-bs-cz/tree/main/Blue%20Shift)
10. Move the downloaded files and the compiled subtitles file (see the section above) to the `root/resources` folder in the extracted folder
11. Drag & drop the whole `root` folder on the `vpk.exe` file located in `Black Mesa/bin` (see above)
12. Wait for the compiling process to complete and then rename the compiled file to `bshift_misc_dir.vpk`
13. Lastly, move the compiled file to your `Black Mesa/bshift` directory (see above)
### Use Czech subtitles
I've not yet figured out how to add subtitles to Blue Shift's menu, so you'll need to first change the subtitles to Czech in normal Black Mesa and then launch Blue Shift (without touching the subtitles there).
