# Black Mesa: Blue Shift - Czech language
This is here now just for archival purposes, since the Czech translation is included in BM:BS Chapter 4 and following. If you still want to download the old translations, click [here](https://github.com/Fjuro/bm-bs-cz/releases/tag/v1.0), but please keep in mind that no support will be provided. If you want to report an issue in the new versions, contact me on Steam.
